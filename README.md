## Inspiration
The prompt for the hackathon was to attempt to solve the problem of recruiting. With the average cost of an on-campus hire being more than $6,000 and with the average time it takes students to find a job to be incredibly long, much in the recruiting world needs to be changed. We invisioned a Tinder like app that allows students to apply to jobs by simply swiping on their phones and a filtering system that helps recruiters and employers save time and money by only seeing the best candidates and thus the idea for Athena was born.

## What it does
Introducing Athena! Athena allows students to enter all of their information one time and allows them to only see jobs where they meet the qualifications. All that is required of the student is to merely respond in 50 words or less to a promp the company provides. Employers get to see all the applicants who meet their inital criteria and then are able to filter down to find the right candidates for the job. This allows both sides of the equation to save time when applying/looking for candidates.

## How we built it
This mobile app was built using Javascript and React-Native, the database used was in MongoDB, the back end was built in Node.js and the web app was built using Javascript and Vue.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Creating a working mobile app, web app, and backend in 30 hours
- Collecting data on and validating the UI for the mobile app
- Validating our idea through surveys and personal interviews
